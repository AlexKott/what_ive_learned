# What I've Learned

With this app it is possible to track your individual learning process through a longer time period.

The basic usage is to add a new "Learn Event" and analyse your progress. You can add several learn events each day. You can also select milestones to mark the exceptional learning goals you achieved.

Learn events need to get a category and a subject (e.g. "Cooking" and "Recipes with potatoes").

Through color-attributes for both category and subject you will be able to get visualisations from different viewpoints.

## Next Step

Implementing a way to display months. Each month will get an own .json file. Switching through the months in View Event mode will be possible.
