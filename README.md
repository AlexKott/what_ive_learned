# What I've Learned

With this app it will be possible to track your individual learning process through a longer time period.

The basic usage will be to add a new "Learn Events" and analyse your progress. You can add one primary and multiple secondary learn events each day. You can also select milestones to mark the exceptional learning goals you achieved.

Learn events need to get a category and a subject (e.g. "Cooking" and "Recipes with potatoes").

Through color-attributes for both category and subject you will be able to get visualisations from different viewpoints.
